# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains my **daily SQL practice** as I build strong fundamentals in databases and query writing.

The goal of this repo is **consistency over perfection** — writing SQL regularly, understanding mistakes, and improving query logic step by step.

---

## 📌 What this repository includes

* Basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`)
* Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `SELF JOIN`)
* Aggregation (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* Subqueries
* Window functions (`OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, `RANK`, etc.)
* LeetCode SQL problems with clean solutions

All queries are written and tested before being committed.
